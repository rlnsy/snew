        <h2>Welcome to Snew, the app for discovering communities that might normally
          remain hidden to you.</h2>

        <p>In order to get info about your content-circles, Snew connects to a reddit account
          and analyzes community vector spaces using various algorithms. New subreddits will appear to you
          and you can quickly and recreate your entire subscription list with the community manager.</p>
